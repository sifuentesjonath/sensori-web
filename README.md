# Sensorium

## Neuro Technology

The envisioned software suite will form a robust ecosystem of bio and neuro metric modules,
catering to a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to
peak performance training, and various therapeutic uses such as neurofeedback and
biofeedback. The design is inherently modular, allowing each component to either work as part
of a holistic system or as standalone software, as per user requirements and use cases.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
